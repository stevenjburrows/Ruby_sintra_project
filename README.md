## Pill reminder

A client has asked for an app where they can mark that the have taken a pill and the when it was taken.  They often forget if or when they take their pills due to the number they take and an app to track it would help them manage this more easily while also helping their health.


### MVP

The app should allow the user to create and edit pills.  
Pills should have a name, type and strength
The app should allow the user to create and edit pill type i.e painkillers, vitamins, etc
When you take a pill the Time should be recorded 
The app should show the pills available and also able to view what pills you have taken.


### Possible extension

Pills should have a maximum amount per day and this is counted down when a pill is taken
Deactivate a pill that is no longer used so canâ€™t be selected.
Show pills taken for a a given day
